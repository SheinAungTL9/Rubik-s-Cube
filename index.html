        <p align="left"><font color="blue">The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle originally invented in <font color="red"><u>1974</u></font>[2][3] by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture<font color="00FF0C"><u><b><i> Ern≈ë Rubik</i></b></u></font>.<br>
             Originally called the <font color="FF8000"><u>Magic Cube</u></font>,[4] the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980<br>
             [5] via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer.<br>
             [6] The cube was released internationally in<font color="red"><u> 1980</u></font> and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture.<br>
              It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. As of January<font color="red"><u> 2009</u></font>, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide,[7]<br>
              [8][needs update] making it the world's bestselling puzzle game[9][10] and bestselling toy.[11]<br><br>

            On the original classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours: white,red, blue, orange, green, and yellow.<br>
             Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use coloured plastic panels instead,<br>
             which prevents peeling and fading.[12] In models as of 1988, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white, and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement.<br>
             13] On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.[14] An internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours.<br>
              For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to have only one colour.<br>
            Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.<br><br>
            
            Although the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used.<br>
             Many speedcubers continue to practice it and similar puzzles; they also compete for the fastest times in various categories.<br>
              Since 2003, the World Cube Association, the international governing body of the Rubik's Cube, has organised competitions worldwide and recognises world records.</font><br></p>
